# 📂 Problem Set 2 — CS50P

This folder contains my solutions for **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python — Problem Set 2**.
Each problem is placed in its own subdirectory with a dedicated `README.md` that describes the task, logic, and implementation details.

## 📚 What I Learned

* Using **loops (`while`, `for`)** to repeat actions efficiently.
* Controlling loop execution with **`break`** and **`continue`** statements.
* Working with **lists** and **dictionaries** to store and organize data.
* Applying **string manipulation** techniques such as `.split()`, `.join()`, `.lower()`, and slicing.
* Validating input and handling user interaction gracefully.
* Writing modular, readable, and consistent Python code that adheres to CS50P standards.
