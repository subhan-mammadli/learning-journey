# 🧠 CS50P – Lecture 2

Welcome to the **Lecture 2** folder of my CS50’s *Introduction to Programming with Python* notes and exercises.

📘 **Contents:**

* **Lecture 2 Notes:** A clear and complete summary of all core topics — including **loops** (`while`, `for`), **`break` / `continue`**, **lists**, **dictionaries**, and **nested loops**.
* **Problem Set 2 Solutions:** My implementations of the exercises related to this lecture, applying loops and data structures in practical examples.

> 💡 Feel free to explore the notes to reinforce your understanding or check out the solutions to see how these concepts come to life in real code.
