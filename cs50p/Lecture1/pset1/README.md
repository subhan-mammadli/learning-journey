## 📚 What I Learned

* Using **conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)** to control program flow.
* Working with **string methods** such as `.lower()`, `.replace()`, and `.strip()`.
* Implementing **logical operators** (`and`, `or`, `not`) for complex conditions.
* Handling **user input** and normalizing data before comparison.
* Writing clean, readable, and reusable Python code following CS50P conventions.
