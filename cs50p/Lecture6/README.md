# 📂 CS50P – Lecture 6

Welcome to the **Lecture 6** folder of my CS50’s *Introduction to Programming with Python* notes and exercises.

📘 **Contents:**

* **Lecture 6 Notes:** A clear and beginner-friendly summary of this lecture’s main concepts — focusing on **working with files**, **CSV data**, **reading & writing with Python**, and **basic image manipulation with Pillow**.
  Covered topics include:

  * Using `open()`, file modes (`"r"`, `"w"`, `"a"`) and why closing a file matters
  * The `with` keyword for automatically managing files
  * Reading files line-by-line, using `.readlines()` and `.rstrip()`
  * Sorting data with `sorted()`, `key=`, and `lambda` functions
  * What CSV files are and why we use them
  * Parsing CSV manually with `.split()` and the limitations of this approach
  * Robust CSV handling with `csv.reader` and `csv.DictReader`
  * Writing data with `csv.writer` and `csv.DictWriter`

* **Images with Pillow (PIL):**

  * Opening and processing image files
  * Working with GIF frames
  * Creating simple animated images with `Image.save()` and `append_images`

* **Problem Set 6 Solutions:** Exercises that apply file handling, CSV parsing, data sorting, and automation in real small programs.

> ✅ **Tip:** Whether handling text files, tables of data, or images — Python offers powerful built-in tools and libraries to work efficiently. Mastering Lecture 6 makes it easier to build real-world applications such as data analyzers, logging systems, or automation scripts.
