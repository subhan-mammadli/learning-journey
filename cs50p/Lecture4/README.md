# 🧠 CS50P – Lecture 4

Welcome to the **Lecture 4** folder of my CS50’s *Introduction to Programming with Python* notes and exercises.

📘 **Contents:**

* **Lecture 4 Notes:** A complete and easy-to-follow summary of this lecture’s main concepts — including **Python libraries**, **modules**, **packages**, **APIs**, and **command-line arguments**.
  Covered topics include:

  * `random`, `statistics`, and `sys` modules
  * Importing specific functions (`from ... import ...`)
  * Handling command-line arguments with `sys.argv` and `sys.exit()`
  * Working with external libraries using `pip` and **PyPI**
  * Fetching web data using `requests` and parsing it with **JSON**
  * Creating and importing your **own modules** (`__name__ == "__main__"`)

* **Problem Set 4 Solutions:** My solutions and implementations related to Lecture 4 — applying modules, APIs, and custom libraries in real coding examples.

> 💡 **Tip:** Explore the notes to strengthen your understanding of how Python interacts with external resources, or check out the solutions to see how these concepts powerfully extend your programs beyond a single file.
