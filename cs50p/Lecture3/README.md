# 🧠 CS50P – Lecture 3
 
Welcome to the **Lecture 3** folder of my CS50’s *Introduction to Programming with Python* notes and exercises.
 
📘 **Contents:**
 
 
- **Lecture 3 Notes:** A complete and beginner-friendly summary of all key topics from this lecture — including **exceptions**, **`try` / `except` / `else`**, **`ValueError`**, **`NameError`**, **reprompting with `while True`**, and best practices for **error handling** in Python.
 
- **Problem Set 3 Solutions:** My implementations of exercises such as **Fuel**, **Grocery**, and **Outdated**, where exception handling and input validation are applied in real-world examples.
 

 
 
💡 Explore the notes to strengthen your understanding of how Python deals with errors, or review the solutions to see these concepts in action through practical programs.
