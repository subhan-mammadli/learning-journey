# 📂 Problem Set 3 — CS50P
 
This folder contains my solutions for **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python — Problem Set 3**. Each problem is organized in its own subdirectory with a dedicated `README.md` explaining the task, logic, and implementation details.
  
## 📌 Problems
 
 
- 🔹 Fuel Gauge
 
- 🔹 Grocery List
 
- 🔹 Felipe's Taqueria
 
- 🔹 Outdated
 

  
## 📚 What I Learned
 
 
- Handling **exceptions** using `try`, `except`, and `else` blocks.
 
- Creating **user-friendly input loops** with `while True` and custom functions.
 
- Managing **input validation** to prevent program crashes.
 
- Using **dictionaries** to store and count items dynamically.
 
- Practicing **string parsing** and **date formatting** with real-world examples.
 
- Writing **modular, readable, and error-resistant** Python code following CS50P best practices.
 

  
## 🚀 How to Run
 
 
1.  
Navigate to a specific problem’s directory:
