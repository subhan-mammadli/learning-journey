# 📂 Problem Set 3 — CS50P

This folder contains my solutions for **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python — Problem Set 3**.  
Each problem is placed in its own subdirectory with a dedicated `README.md` that describes the task, logic, and implementation details.

## 📚 What I Learned

* Handling **exceptions** gracefully using `try`, `except`, and `else` blocks.  
* Implementing **input validation** and **reprompting** loops with `while True`.  
* Using **functions** to write modular and reusable code.  
* Managing **lists** and **dictionaries** to organize and count user input.  
* Parsing and reformatting **strings and dates** using conditional logic and built-in methods.  
* Writing clean, readable, and Pythonic code consistent with CS50P style conventions.
