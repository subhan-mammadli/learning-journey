# 🧪 CS50P – Lecture 5

Welcome to the **Lecture 5** folder of my CS50’s *Introduction to Programming with Python* notes and exercises.

📘 **Contents:**

* **Lecture 5 Notes:** A clear and beginner-friendly summary of this lecture’s main concepts — focusing on **software testing**, **assertions**, **pytest**, and **Python packages**.
  Covered topics include:

  * The `assert` keyword and how it detects incorrect behavior in functions
  * Handling errors such as `AssertionError` using `try-except`
  * Writing automated tests with the **pytest** framework
  * Creating dedicated test files (`test_*.py` / `*_test.py`)
  * Using `pytest.raises` to test whether a function raises the correct error
  * Organizing projects using **packages** and `__init__.py`
  * Running tests across an entire directory (simple and verbose modes)

* **Problem Set 5 Solutions:** A collection of my solutions for Lecture 5 — including writing tests, validating functions, and applying best testing practices in real examples.

> ✅ **Tip:** Testing isn’t just for big projects — even small programs become more reliable and easier to maintain when supported by automated tests. Explore the notes to learn the tools, or browse the solutions to see how they are used in practice.
