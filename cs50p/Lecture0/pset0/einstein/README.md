# ⚡ Einstein Problem – Energy Calculation

This is a solution to the **Einstein problem** from CS50p.
The goal is to calculate energy using **Einstein’s famous equation**:

[
E = mc^2
]

## 📝 Problem Description

Write a program that:

* Takes **mass (m)** as input from the user.
* Converts the input to an integer (since `input()` returns a string).
* Defines **c = 300,000,000** (the speed of light).
* Computes **E = m × c²** using the `**` operator for exponentiation.
* Prints the result.

## 💻 Solution

The solution can be found in [einstein.py](./einstein.py).

## 📌 Key Concepts

* **input() + int()** → Read and convert input to integer.
* **Exponentiation (`**`)** → Used to calculate (c^2).
* **print()** → Displays the calculated energy.
