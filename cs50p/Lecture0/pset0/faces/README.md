# 🙂 Faces Problem – Text to Emoji

This is a solution to the **Faces problem** from CS50p.
The goal is to **replace text-based smileys (`:)`, `:(`) with their emoji equivalents**.

---

## 📝 Problem Description

Write a program that:

* Takes input from the user.
* Converts `:)` into 🙂 and `:(` into 🙁.
* Prints the modified string.

> Note: This could also be solved using **if-else conditions**, but since CS50p hasn’t covered that topic yet, the solution is implemented using `str.replace()`.

---

## 💻 Solution

The solution can be found in [faces.py](./faces.py).

## 📌 Key Concepts

* **input()**: Reads a string from the user.
* **str.replace()**: Replaces substrings inside a string.
* **print()**: Displays the modified text.
